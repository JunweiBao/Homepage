I received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019, after 6 years of NLP research in MSRA. He has published more than 20 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, e.g., ACL and AAAI. Currently, he focuses on NLP and conversational AI research including pre-training, dialog, question answering, reasoning, machine reading comprehension, and text generation. You can reach me through NAME at gmail dot com (NAME=baojunwei001).
