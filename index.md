I received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019, after 6 years of NLP research in MSRA. He has published more than 20 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, e.g., ACL and AAAI. Currently, he focuses on NLP and conversational AI research including pre-training, dialog, question answering, reasoning, machine reading comprehension, and text generation. You can reach me through NAME at gmail dot com (NAME=baojunwei001).


## More about me

I am from Anshan in Liaoning Provice. I earned my Ph.D. degree at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in Jan. 2019, under the instructions of Prof. [Ming Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-HBuUWAAAAAJ&hl=en) and montored by [Nan Duan](https://nanduan.github.io/). After that, I was a researcher at JD AI Research at JD.com, Beijing, working with Prof. [Xiaodong He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W5WbqgoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Youzheng Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/erzhengcn/).
