# Welcome to Junwei's Homepage

<img align="left" src="citations.jpg" width=140 height=150 alt="a photo" style="padding-right:10px">

I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019, after 6 years of NLP research in MSRA. I have published more than 20 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, e.g., ACL and AAAI. Currently, I focus on NLP and conversational AI research including pre-training, dialog, question answering, reasoning, machine reading comprehension, and text generation. You can reach me through NAME at gmail dot com (NAME=baojunwei001).

## Education

I am from Anshan in Liaoning Provice. I earned my Ph.D. degree at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in Jan. 2019, under the instructions of Prof. [Ming Zhou](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=a0w5c0gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Tiejun Zhao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%B5%B5%E9%93%81%E5%86%9B/7533734), and montored by [Nan Duan](https://nanduan.github.io/). After that, I was a researcher at JD AI Research at JD.com, Beijing, working with Prof. [Xiaodong He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W5WbqgoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Youzheng Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/erzhengcn/).
