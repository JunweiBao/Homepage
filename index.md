I am an NLP researcher at [JD AI Research](jdai.md) and an engineer at the Inteligent Service and Product department in JD Technology (JDT:京东科技). I have published more than 20 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, e.g., ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING and AAAI. Currently, I focus on NLP and conversational AI research including pre-training, dialog, question answering, reasoning, machine reading comprehension, and text generation. You can reach me through NAME at gmail dot com (NAME=baojunwei001).

## Education

I am from Anshan in Liaoning Provice. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology ([HIT:哈尔滨工业大学](http://www.hit.edu.cn/)) at January 03, 2019, after 6 years of NLP research in MSRA. I earned my Ph.D. degree under the instructions of Prof. [Ming Zhou](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=a0w5c0gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Tiejun Zhao](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhaotiejun), and montored by [Nan Duan](https://nanduan.github.io/). After that, I was a researcher at JD AI Research at JD.com, Beijing, working with Prof. [Xiaodong He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W5WbqgoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Youzheng Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/erzhengcn/).
